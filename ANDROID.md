#Install:

Under "\android\myBierFit\app\build\outputs\apk" copy the app-debug.apk on your
android device or directly install it.

You may activate "install 3rd party"!

#Usage:

You can sign up User and login, but just on the android device. On the homepage
is another account management. Every android account is linked to the admin on
the homepage, because on admin we have all "bierdeckel" data.
