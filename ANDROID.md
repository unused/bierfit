#Install:

Under "\android\myBierFit\app\build\outputs\apk" copy the app-debug.apk on your
android device or directly install it.

You may activate "install 3rd party"!

#Usage:

You can create new accounts and login to them, but only on the android device. The homepage
uses another account management. Because the user accounts haven't any functionality and data,
all of them are linked to a default account (admin). At the moment the user is
unable to create/collect data.
